# pwManager
This is a password manager written in python, it uses the Qt-Framework for the GUI implementation.


There is also a brute force program to "recover" lost master passwords. The encryption is secure as the key is hashed before it is encrypted.

TODO: 
* Optimize the brute force process (multithreading)
* Build interface/API for hashcat --> can use GPU and is much faster
